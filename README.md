I graduated from Indiana University with a degree in Finance in 1998 and became a financial advisor/stock broker.  In 2002, I co-founded an online travel agency called CheapCaribbean.com and was in charge of Marketing, Pricing and Revenue Management.  We sold the company in 2013 and since then, I have been an independent commercial real estate investor and broker.  I also recently worked for a blockchain company as Director of Marketing.
My goal is to work as a FinTech developer and gain experience in all aspects of FinTech programming.
FinTech (specifically blockchain) is the most exciting disruptive innovation currently and I just want to be a part of it.
